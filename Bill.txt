The 9th grade class initiates students into the world of literature and writing at the high school level, building skills and understandings that will serve them in their English classes and beyond. At its core, the class is about stories and the communities for whom they have meaning; students learn to read closely, taking their own observations and inferences as starting points for interpretation.

First of all, you have a stellar work ethic but you need to work on completing your homework assignments and only have 20/38 homework assignments turned in. You sometimes contribute in class discussions and most of the time you share meaningful ideas, questions, and thoughts. In addition, you can show me your writing skills at times but you are a good reader.

Tests have been more of a difficulty for you. You have been getting consistently below 80% on your cumulative test scores, so I suggest you practice a bit more to solidify the concepts. Indeed, I can see the effort you put into this class, and I can really see the improvement from the first semester. Even though you have been improving, I think you still have room to grow. Being more proactive by emailing questions or meeting during office hours could bolster your understanding of the material. Overall, I think you still have a lot of room to improve. Try spend more time reading and writing so you can perform well in the second semester finals. 

English 9 is a difficult class, and I think you still have some room to improve. Your final grade for the semester was C+. I look forward to working with you for the rest of the year.
