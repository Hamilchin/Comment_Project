The 9th grade class initiates students into the world of literature and writing at the high school level, building skills and understandings that will serve them in their English classes and beyond. At its core, the class is about stories and the communities for whom they have meaning; students learn to read closely, taking their own observations and inferences as starting points for interpretation.

First of all, you have a stellar work ethic but you need to work on completing your homework assignments and only have 20/38 homework assignments turned in. You have done an astounding job at contributing in class conversations by being one of the main contributers but you need to work on making your ideas, questions, and thoughts more meaningful. In addition, you are an amazing writer and reader.

You have been really well on your tests, showing how well you know your stuff. Over 90% consistently on your cumulative test scores, so nice job! However, I can see the effort you put into this class, but I think you still have a lot of room to improve.  Truly, thanks for being so proactive when it comes to asking for help. Your improvement really shows. Overall, you have been performing really well this semester. Keep it up!

English 9 is a difficult class, but you really thrived in this class. Your final grade for the semester was A+. I look forward to working with you for the rest of the year.
