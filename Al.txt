The 9th grade class initiates students into the world of literature and writing at the high school level, building skills and understandings that will serve them in their English classes and beyond. At its core, the class is about stories and the communities for whom they have meaning; students learn to read closely, taking their own observations and inferences as starting points for interpretation.

First of all, you can show your great work ethic at times and you have done an astounding job with 38/38 homework assignments completed! You rarely contribute in class discussions but you share meaningful ideas, questions, and thoughts! In addition, you are an amazing writer and reader.

We need to talk about your tests. You have been performing pretty badly, and I'm concerned that you don't really know your material (getting below 70% on your cumulative test score). However, I can see the effort you put into this class, and I can really see the improvement from the first semester. Even though you have been improving, I think you still have room to grow. Being more proactive by emailing questions or meeting during office hours could bolster your understanding of the material. Overall, you really need to work on your skills in English 9. Let's have a talk on how best to make that happen.

English 9 is a hard class, and I think you could have done better in the first semester. Your final grade for the semester was D-. I look forward to working with you for the rest of the year.
